Cooling methods currently in place:
- 'once through' cooling systems use cooling water from external source lie a river and with heat exchanger tubes that returns the water
- recirculating cooling systems recycle water continuously using heat transfer, large footprint. open recirculating
- mechanical drafts have fans moving air through tower
- good cooling system explanation page: https://www.airbestpractices.com/technology/cooling-systems/six-basic-types-liquid-cooling-systems
- refrigerant can absorb heat away from mineral water in a reservoir
