### Project Management ###

The project went through several different stages, but management remained broadly consistent throughout until later stages of specification within the project.

**Leadership**

The leadership style throughout (despite the group having no set leader) aimed to be transformative and democratic - changes were discussed with the rest of the team befor implementation, and consultation with Majicom was conducted regularly to avoid confusion and potential for 

Majicom implemented a slightly different laissez-faire leadership style encouraging creativity with minimal limits around the core concept of achieving active cooling for the water tank.

**Task distribution**

- Initial project idea generation - all
- System modelling framework - Jakub
- First principle analysis - Jamie, Jakub
- Experimental work - Jamie, Jakub
- CAD modelling and validation - Oscar

In more detail the tasks were distributed as following:
- Jakub: System modelling including heat loss calculations, on demand heat transfer analysis, Peltier cell vs Refrigerant cycle investigation and Experiment design
- Jamie: Mains heat exchanger analysis, heat loss estimation, Experimental data collection
- Oscar: Heat loss calculations and modelling with CAD

**Team management**

The team strategy evolved throughout the project to meet the increasing demands of key deliverables, beginning with a strong collaborative effort in preparing the initial group presentation. This early stage focused on aligning everyoneâ€™s understanding of the project scope and brainstorming creative approaches. 

For the initial project proposal, slides covering technical content,  and presenting were divided evenly, allowing each member to contribute while gaining insight into all aspects of the project.

For the interim presentation, the team refined its strategy. With clearer task allocations emerging, members focused more on their technical areas while still contributing to joint outputs. Regular meetings ensured continuity and cohesion, with feedback loops to integrate individual work into a unified message. This period marked a shift towards more autonomous work, balanced by team review and collective editing.

In preparation for the final presentation and group report, collaboration intensified. Each member contributed to their specialised section, while joint sessions were held to polish and align the final outputs. Visuals, data interpretation, and conclusions were refined collaboratively to ensure clarity and coherence.

The individual report phase saw a transition to independent work, though team members continued informal peer support, discussing findings and approaches. This blended strategy of shared responsibility and individual accountability helped maintain a high standard throughout the project.
