3) Good Health and Well-Being: The more cooling that we could create, the more that users might be motivated to be hydrated, which has obvious health benefits. We did however have to consider that cooler isn't always better, through questionnaires we knew that a range of users had different favourite drinking temperatures.

6) Clean Water and Sanitation: The kiosk creates clean water by passing tap water through a filter, we have had to consider this in our design as not to propose ideas that are likely to make the water unsafe to drink. This means not allowing water to sit stagnant while open to the air as to prevent diseases such as Legionnaires'. When considering a heat exchanger with incoming tap water, it was imperative to not allow any risk of conact between the tap and filtered water.

9) Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure: The kiosk is by nature achieving this goal, employing local businesses, innovating in design, and feeding into infrastructure. Cooling the water increases well-being in the universities in which it will be initially implemented, which should hopefully feed further into innovation.

12) Responsible Consumption and Production: We had to bear in mind not being wasteful in our design. Energy-wise, we considered the amount of insulation needed to only lose a small amount of our cooling power to the environment, and the whole design revolves around being as efficient as possible. With the water, the idea of constantly running tap water around the tank to cool it was ruled out due to the large water waste that it would cause.

13) Climate Action: We endeavoured to make sure our cooling method was compatible with the amount of power provided by the solar panels and battery proposed by Majicom to power the kiosk. This would mean green energy, and also more predictable energy compared to taking from the mains.

Although our work was not digital, we needed to understand the interface between the kiosk and user. We learnt that kiosks similar to Majicoms' would normally have a vendor to dispense the water / good for the user. Majicom had only the screen, which meant we needed to consider the extra time taken to figure out the interface in rural areas of Africa compared to in the UK, which impacts queueing time and consequently dispensing rate.
