# Evaporative Cooling Experimental Testing Plan

## Experimental Testing

We will experimentally evaluate and optimise a small-scale evaporative cooling system by comparing the effects of different fabric materials and airflow conditions on the temperature of a 1L water container. The goal is to identify the most efficient combination of material and fan setup (different positions and speeds) that delivers maximum cooling using minimal water and energy.

The experiments will be conducted under controlled indoor conditions and repeated outdoors (if feasible), simulating the intended application in Tanzanian climates.

## Experimental Method

### Prepare Materials
- Cut each fabric sample to the same size and thickness (e.g. A4)
- Pre-soak all samples in water for 5 minutes
- Lightly wring and weigh each sample before wrapping (optional)

### Bottle Setup
- Use 6 identical 1L bottles filled with room-temperature water
- Wrap each bottle tightly with one fabric type (ensuring same thickness)
- Secure fabric with elastic bands or tape for consistent contact

### Assign Airflow
- Place 3 bottles under fans with variable speeds (~15â€“20 cm away), inside a bucket or enclosed container to control airflow
- Leave 3 bottles as control samples with no fan
- Ensure all bottles are in the same environment (same bench, lighting, etc.)

### Record Starting Temperature
- Use a basic thermometer to measure starting water temperature in each bottle
- Ensure consistent timing and measurement across samples

###  Begin Test
- Run experiment for approx. 3 hours
- Re-wet fabrics halfway through if needed (record time and water amount)
- Note general environmental conditions (approx. room temp, airflow)

### Record Final Data
- Measure final water temperature for each bottle using the same thermometer
- Optionally weigh each fabric again to estimate evaporated water mass

## What to Analyse

- **Cooling performance**: Which combinations gave the biggest temperature drop?
- **Fan effectiveness**: Did the fan significantly improve cooling across all materials?
- **Water usage**: Which materials lost the most water (if weighing)?
- **Practicality**: Which materials stayed wet the longest, dried too quickly, or were easiest to handle?

---

## Final Output

From this test, we will determine:
- The most effective material + airflow pairing
- Whether including a fan or multiple fans is worth the extra energy
- Realistic estimates of water use and cooling potential in a kiosk setting
