# Key Notes from Majicom Meeting (26/05)
## Numerical and Experimental design
- Parameters: Surface Area to Volume ratio, relative humidity in comparison with the ambient airflow around the bottle, and the total path length for the airflow. 
- Consider the fact that having soaked material will cause water to drip to base and this can open the scope to a water recirculation system -> a reservoir with a wicking system could be implemented to ensure that the material is always kept wet, or a pipe that feeds from the reservoir to the material. 
- Having two PC fans in parallel at different positions of the bottle, by cutting holes in an extra container that encases the bottle so that the airflow can be contained while also ensuring it is close enough to affect the material
- Ensure more rapid evaporation by using Team 1's peltier cells in conjunction as the heat produced from that can be used to warm the material and encourage heat from the water in the bottle to travel out? 
- Need to consider that incoming tap water is initially cool (~15Â°C) but heats up over time if left untouched so keeping that water cool should be of priority too
- Contingency for legionella disease risk if water is stored long-term in fabric systems.
- In report, suggest future complex proof of concept: circular tanks with material-coated airflow ducts, embedded systems. Consider alternatives to fabric jackets if time allows (e.g. ducts, pipe wrapping).
