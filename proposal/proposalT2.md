# Problem description

Brief overview of the problem, context and engineering approach to tackle the problem, and explaining our approach in brief.

Assisted Passive Cooling is the process of continuously cooling the bulk water storage through indirect means. The aim is to achieve a drop of temperature of 3-5 degrees of the main tank through evaporative, radiative or other assisted passive cooling means.

# Presentation of the proposal
Need to upload slides as pdf somehow

### Types of Passive Cooling

### Solutions 

- Enhancing airflow through the kiosk
- Changing the tank geometry to create more consistent cooling throughout the whole volume of water
- Exploring locally used methods for crop storage and cooling
- Changing tank material to allow for water seep and better evaporative cooling
- Dehydration of airflow over the tank to improve capacity for cooling
- Radiative material coating 

# Assessment of the quality of the proposal

Evaluate its value in the context of the project. What will it solve, is it safe, etc. Check Laraâ€™s slides for what to cover.
