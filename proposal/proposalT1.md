# Problem description

The aim of this project is to investigate a way to chill water before distribution from a Majicom kiosk. The kiosks have been loated in tropical areas and require a way of cooling the water independently of temperature and humidity. This leads to 2 possibilities: active and passive cooling.

# Presentation of the proposal

### Project focus

Active cooling methods have been well-researched and applied in industry. Every fridge runs on an evaporative cycle and this technology is very well developed. Hence, there is no need for a proof of concept of this cooling method. However what this project will focus on is how to more efficiently use the energy and integrate this cooling method with the kiosk. This requires first a broad exploration of the ideaspace, followed by more detailed design and thermal modelling. The main determined tasks include: Broad exploration and design calculation for determining the most likely dierections for progress, detailed feasibility study ncluding costing and testing proof of concept designs.

Deliverables:

- exploration of the full design space of active water cooling system
- Investigation of alternative, aided water cooling methods including novel research ideas, such as teh use of  spectrally selective materials
- Providing proofs of concept of most promising water cooling methods
- Preliminary and detailed design, material and component selection
- Outline of the cost and impact of proposed solutions

### Reaserch areas

- Feasibility of the use of Peltier modules instead of Evaporative cycles
- Exploring the limiting factors on the speed of heat transfer and cold water dispensal
- exploring the suitability of chosen methods for local manufacture and repairs
- providing a proof of concept of the use of spectrally selective insulation

# Assessment of the quality of the proposal

This project aims to bring what is considered common in developed countries - chilled water - to the developing world. It satisfies all the characteristics of inclusive innnovation as outlined below:
- Responsible - brings no negative impact and does no harm. Decreases teh problem of waste and low recyclanility of one time use water bottles
- Resposive - answers the needs of the users - from a survey on the trial users, 50% of them preferred chilled water
- Accessive - the project aims to more than halve the price of clean cold water to the users in Africa, while also reducing teh waste problem
- Context appriopriate - our solutions will be designed to be easy to repair or replace in the developing countries, focusing on the robustness and modularity
- Adds significant value - currently no other water kiosk is providing chilled water and as such this would be the first of its kind!
