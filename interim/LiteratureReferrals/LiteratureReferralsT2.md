# Reference List - Evaporative Cooling Project

This page contains all key references used throughout the project, including academic papers, technical guides, and practical design inspirations. Each entry includes a link (where possible), key notes on why it was useful, and a path to any saved files in the repo.

## Academic Papers and Sites

1. **N. Kapilan et al. (2023)**
   *A comprehensive review on evaporative cooling systems*

4. 

5. **HSE**
   *Managing legionella in hot and cold water systems*
   ðŸ”— [Link](https://www.hse.gov.uk/healthservices/legionella.htm)
   - This bacteria is found in water and can multiply when temperatures are between 20-45 degrees but do not survive above 60, and are dormant below 20. Inhaling airborne water droplets with this bacteria can develop Legionnaire's disease, a type of fatal pneumonia.
   - Cold water should be stored and distributed below 20 degrees, and routine checks should be done to clean the system
   - Keep pipe work as short as possible and ensure materials used doesn't encourage growth, with airtight lids
   - Copper and silver ionisation and biocide treatements also work but needs to be part of the water treatement too during installation
