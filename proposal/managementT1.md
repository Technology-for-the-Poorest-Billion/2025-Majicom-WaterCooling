# Project management plan

## The people
Large part of our project includes brainstorming and as such will require large collaboration. However each of us has separate strengths and the tasks will be tuned to satisfy them:

- Jakub - strengths: heat transfer and thermodynamics
- Oscar - 3D5 water engineering module, Very limited electrical expertise, 
- Jamie

These lead to the following intial task distribution:
- Jakub - feasibilty of Peltier modules and proof of concept of spectrally selective materials
- Oscar
- Jamie

To be filled: Budgeting, ease of access in the developing world, limit on heat transfer, CAD design and visualisation

## Resources:

Parts required:
At such an early stage it is difficult to exactly pinpoint what products will be necessary. However, for any tests to be conducted teh following will be necessary:
 - temperature probes
 - water containers
 - Peltier cooling module
 - Piping
 - 
We have determined that most likely there is no need to make a proof of concept of the use of an evaporative cycle, which would take away large part of the risk and cost of the project otherwise.
