# Water cooling using a Peltier cell - proof of cencept

The aim of this experiment is to detemrine the viability of using a peltier cell to cool water on demand.
in ordeer ot do this it was encessary to find the effectiveness of teh Peltier cell under realistic conditions




The experiment conducted encountered several unexpected obstacles. 

Firstly, we did not have access to a power supply strong enough to create as much cooling as we had anticipated.
This meant that the temperature drop was on the order of 0.1 C which is the same as teh experimental error.
This means that although this value is of the order of magnitude as predicted prior to the experiment,
it is of no use in making predictions.
This means that teh attempt to measure the Peletier modules effectiveness has failed.
However, several conclusions can nonetheless be drawn:

- Peltier cells require a lot of current and that is more than conventional power systems usually work with. Thuis suggests taht the electrical side of the setup will be harder to build and more costly
- Peltier cells require a large amount of cooling. It was noted that even at this low power, the cell heated up considerably which reduced the cooling efficiency. For such a setup to work a large fan and cooling system would be needed.
- At the flow rates expected in the kiosk the rate of heat transfer was not high enough. This may be partially due to the low power available, but could be at least partially due to not enough heat transfer in the water cooled plate.

Together the problems outlined above point to one conclusion. The viability of Peltier cooling on demand in the conditions experienced by the kiosk is very limited. The high power demand and low heat trasnfer rates suggest that other options should be investigated for cooling.
