# Problem description

Brief overview of the problem, context and engineering approach to tackle the problem, and explaining our approach in brief.

Assisted Passive Cooling is the process of continuously cooling the bulk water storage through indirect means. The aim is to achieve a drop of temperature of 3-5 degrees of the main tank through evaporative, radiative or other assisted passive cooling means.

### PCM

Free cooling:

PCMs can be used for a free cooling approach to rooms and storage vessels as described in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778816302419 . At night a ventillation system coupled with the natural temperature drop in the air is used to force cool air over the PCM, allowing it to solidify. Note that it is important that at night there is good airflow as the solidification process heats up the surrounding air, which needs to be vacated from the kiosk.

During the day when the ambient temperature exceeds the melting point threshold, the PCM melts, allowing for the vessel to be cooled again. The PCM heat exchanger is designed as a series of thin PCM sheets which air flows through, maximising the heat exchange area. There are a wide range of PCMs available on the market, particularly parrafin based PCMs, which provide a solidifcation region within the expected range of temperatures (20-30 degrees) 

An interesting challenge will be how much of the heat removal actually contributes to water cooling, whether that is by circulating the cool air over the tank or by directly cooling the water. It is also very possible that this technology could be used in conjuction with the evaporative cooling design. The PCM cools the air and improves the efficiency of evaporative cooling. Additionally both PCMs and evaporative cooling require a similar fan infrastructure, meaning that much of the design is shared. 

Another question with PCMs is what the power consumption and night would need to look like, and whether stored battery power would be sufficient to operate the kiosk for sufficiently long to resolidify the PCM. 



### Project Focus 

Evaporative Cooling & Airflow:

There are two main questions with evaporative cooling to answer. Can we alter the design of the tank to improve the rate of surface evaporation and its effect on water temperature? Can we improve the airflow through the kiosk to prevent stagnation? These questions provide the foundation for the development of an evaporative cooling solution for the Majicom kiosk. The core aim is to verify the efficacy of evaporative cooling as a possible solution 

Core Deliverables:

- A redesigned tank geometry
- Ventillation location and fan positioning within the kiosk.
- Required fan power / size
- Material selection 

Secondary Deliverables:

- Dehumidification method for inlet air
- Simulation or demonstration of airflow quality
- 

Radiative Cooling:

Phase Changing Materials:

The main questions regarding phase changing material are to understand their capacity to remove energy from a system, how practically they are installed and whether they introduce any complexity into the operation or lifespan of the kiosk.

Core Deliverables:

- Measurement of energy removal by PCMs
- Demonstration that PCMs can be reset to their solid form
- Estimate of the volume of cool water that PCMs can produce before needing to reset

Secondary Deliverables: 

- Design of the tank to maximise water cooling
