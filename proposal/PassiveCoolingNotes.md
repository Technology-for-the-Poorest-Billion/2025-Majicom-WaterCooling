# Assisted Passive Cooling for Majicom

Our team is developing a cheap, scalable passive cooling system for a solar-powered water purification kiosk in Tanzania. The local conditions are warm and humid, with a 6W solar panel powering the system. We’re focusing on assisted passive cooling—strategies that help retain cool temperatures rather than actively cooling the water—working with a £150 budget and 3 weeks for testing.

## 1. Evaporative Cooling with Enhanced Airflow and Radiative Protection

### Concept
This method goes beyond just wrapping a tank in a damp cloth—it creates a controlled microclimate that maximises evaporation efficiency. We use a breathable wicking jacket (cotton/jute), a low-power fan to promote airflow, and optional porous clay panels between the fabric and tank to retain moisture longer.

### Mechanism
- Evaporation rate increases with airflow: **rate ∝ air velocity × (1 – relative humidity)**
- Shading reduces radiative heat gain
- Clay prolongs evaporative effect
- Fan circulation prevents heat stagnation inside the kiosk

### Real-World Examples
- **Zeer Pot Coolers (Nigeria/Sudan):** Clay-based evaporation systems lowered produce temperatures by up to 14°C  
- **MIT Passive Cooling Pavilion (2019):** Ceramic + airflow used for building-scale passive cooling  
- **Evaporative Cooling Pads (India/SE Asia):** Fan-assisted wet pad systems in agriculture and greenhouses

### Testing Plan
- Wrap water containers in fabric (wet/dry variants)
- Use fans and reflective lids in controlled setups
- Track temp/humidity every 10 mins over 5–6 hours

### Materials
- Cotton/burlap wicking fabric  
- Clay/terracotta panels (if available)  
- USB or solar-powered fans (£10–15)  
- Mylar or reflective roofing  
- Timber frame for shade  
- Water bottles (1–2L)  
- Temperature and humidity sensors

## 2. Modular PCM Cooling Panels with Heat Sink Integration

### Concept
We use PCM panels (melting point ~26–30°C) clipped around the tank to passively absorb heat. Thin aluminium fins or thermal interface plates improve heat transfer from the tank to the PCM. The system is wrapped in reflective insulation and recharges passively overnight.

### Mechanism
- Heat conducted through tank walls → into PCM  
- Aluminium spreads heat effectively (≈ 205 W/m·K)  
- PCM melts to absorb latent heat and buffers temperature rise  
- Modular sleeves make it scalable and easy to maintain  
- PCMs can last over 1,000 thermal cycles

### Real-World Examples
- **Arktek PCM cold storage (WHO/UNICEF):** Vaccine transport with 35-day cooling  
- **Solar-powered fridges in India:** PCM stabilises fluctuating solar input  
- **Food delivery boxes (India/Kenya):** Passive thermal protection in transit

### Testing Plan
- Use commercial or DIY PCM packs (salt hydrate, paraffin)
- Attach packs around 1L bottles with elastic or tape
- Add aluminium strips between bottle and PCM
- Expose to sunlight or heat lamp for 4–6 hrs
- Monitor temperature and PCM melting duration

### Materials
- PCM packs (~£30)  
- Recycled aluminium/metal strips  
- Bubble wrap or foam (~£10)  
- IR thermometer  
- Optional: 3D-printed brackets or straps

## 3. Insulated Tank: Air Gap + Radiative Cooling + Embedded Thermal Mass

### Concept
We propose a double-walled tank with a 2–3 cm air cavity, wrapped in reflective foil and surrounded by thermal mass (e.g., ceramic tiles, stones). Optionally, PCM gel packs can be embedded in the base. This slows heat gain using layers of resistance and mass.

### Mechanism
- Air gap reduces conductive heat  
- Reflective wrap limits solar radiation absorption  
- Thermal mass buffers temperature spikes by absorbing energy gradually  
- Mimics thermos-like insulation using accessible materials

### Innovation Highlights
- Multi-layered passive thermal protection  
- Made from inexpensive/recycled components  
- Easily integrated into existing kiosk setups

### Real-World Examples
- **Earthship water storage (New Mexico):** Buried tanks with layered insulation  
- **CoolAnt (India):** Terracotta cooling with passive airflow  
- **Refrigeration trucks (Kenya):** Thermal mass bricks for diesel-free cooling

### Testing Plan
- Nest bottles inside a container with 2–3 cm air gap  
- Place tile/stone fragments around the bottle base  
- Wrap outer shell in Mylar or reflective ducting  
- Compare against bare bottles, and layered setups

### Materials
- Two container sizes (for nesting)  
- Mylar foil or white paint (~£5)  
- Recycled bricks/tiles  
- Foam/bubble wrap (~£10)  
- Water bricks or PCM packs (optional)  
- Temperature sensors
