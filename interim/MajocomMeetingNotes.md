## Key Notes from Majicom Meeting (26/05)

- Consider surface area, relative humidity, and path length for airflow.
- Minimise water loss at the base — explore water recirculation systems.
- Quantify fan power consumption: needs to be low enough for solar integration.
- Explore heating effect of Peltiers (if future testing).
- Test fan orientation: side vs bottom airflow, use two PC fans in parallel if needed.
- Incoming tap water is initially cool (~15°C) but heats up — how do we maintain low temp?
- Address **legionella risk** if water is stored long-term in fabric systems.
- Suggest future complexity: circular tanks with material-coated airflow ducts, embedded systems.
- Consider alternatives to fabric jackets if time allows (e.g. ducts, pipe wrapping).
