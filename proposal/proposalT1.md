# Problem description

The aim of this project is to investigate a way to chill water before distribution from a Majicom kiosk. The kiosks have been loated in tropical areas and require a way of cooling the water independently of temperature and humidity. This leads to 2 possibilities: active and passive cooling.

# Presentation of the proposal
Deliverables:

- exploration of the full design space of active water cooling system
- Investigation of alternative, aided water cooling methods including novel research ideas, such as teh use of  spectrally selective materials
- Providing proofs of concept of most promising water cooling methods
- Preliminary and detailed design, material and component selection
- Outline of the cost and impact of proposed solutions
