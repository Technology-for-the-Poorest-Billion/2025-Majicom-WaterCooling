Main Objectives

Assisted Passive Water Cooling
Objective: Investigate the opportunities, performance and implementations of a passive water cooling approach that will reduce the overall water temperature in a 100-litre storage tank so that the temperature of the water dispensed will be several degrees lower than without cooling.

Active Water Cooling
Objective: Investigate strategies, opportunities and possible implementations that can be used to cool water, so that when dispensed (typically @ 500ml), the water temperature is 5C or more below that of the water stored in the kiosk water-tank.

Cooling methods currently in place:
- 'once through' cooling systems use cooling water from external source lie a river and with heat exchanger tubes that returns the water
- recirculating cooling systems recycle water continuously using heat transfer, large footprint. open recirculating
- mechanical drafts have fans moving air through tower
- good cooling system explanation page: https://www.airbestpractices.com/technology/cooling-systems/six-basic-types-liquid-cooling-systems
- refrigerant can absorb heat away from mineral water in a reservoir
-  chiller has a mechanical compression device that converts energy into compressed refigerant using a compressor
- evaporative cooling
     - inner pot with watersoaked sand between it and outer pot and the clay lowers the inner pot temp by around 10-15 degrees (clay pots) or using a wet pad that has air passing through 
     - high capillarity materials can draw water upwards and expose to air, promoting evaporation - can wrap water tank in wicking fabric connected to a reservoir of water that cools the tank - adding fins and vertical channels to increase surface area and airflow
     - solar powered fans to push air over wet surfaces or solar pumped water recirculation over cooling towers or vertical fabric walls
