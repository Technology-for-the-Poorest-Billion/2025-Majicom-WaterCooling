## Active cooling - ideas

Requirements:

- 500 ml/min of cold water
- 175 W of cooling power
- independent of humidity - the main difference of our approach should not be the way energy is used but the fact that it works independently of external conditions

Solutions:

 - Peltier modules: only 10-15% efficiency results in 1000We needed which would require $2m^2$ PV panels which is too big
 - Fridge/Het pump circuits - COP = 1.5- 2.5 ==> 80-100We needed ==> $0.2m^2$
 - Radiative cooling? - techincally passive, but also independent of humidity so we could look into it as well

What to do?
- If we considered just fridge circuits the demostration possibilities would be limited ( simply buy a fridge ?? ). However, combining it with radiative cooling could offer the possibility of designing a whole system of radiative heat sinks + heat pumps which has not really been done before
- maybe we could make a mathematical/physical model of the whole system in python?
- 


Tasks to choose?
- do we want ot buy some kind of a fridge?
- do we want to modify it to fit our specified water temperature drop?
- do we want to investigate buy/make selectively radiative materials to investigate their effect?

Precise tasks
- Make budget
- make presentation
- choose products to purchase before the system closes
- split the tasks between the 3 of us
