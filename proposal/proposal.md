# Presentation of the proposal

## Assisted Passive Cooling 

### Summary 

Assisted Passive Cooling is the process of continuously cooling the bulk water storage through indirect means. The aim is to achieve a drop of temperature of 3-5 degrees of the main tank through evaporative, radiative or other assisted passive cooling means.

### Types of Passive Cooling

### Solutions 

- Enhancing airflow through the kiosk
- Changing the tank geometry to create more consistent cooling throughout the whole volume of water
- Exploring locally used methods for crop storage and cooling
- Changing tank material to allow for water seep and better evaporative cooling
- Dehydration of airflow over the tank to improve capacity for cooling
- Radiative material coating 


## Active Cooling 

Active cooling is the direct cooling of a body of water through the implementation of a thermal cycle. This has a capacity to achieve a greater temperature drop than passive cooling, but is very energy intensive. Solutions will look to explore the maximum temperature drop achievable at expected energy levels, as well as where best to implement this solution. This solution will also focus on balancing demand for cool water with supply rate.
