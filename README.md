# Technology-for-the-poorest-Billion---Majicom

The main aim of this project is to aid Majicom in design of a water cooling system for water kiosks placed in Kenia and Tanzania. This would differentiate Majicom from all the other kiosks as none provides water cooling features. This project focused on active cooling methods for reducing water temperature irrespectively of environmental conditions.

We looked at different cooling options and ways ot compare them to evaluate the best one. The project resulted in creation of a modelling software to aid our decision and that could be useful in further developing the kiosk. This allowed to investigate several different cooling options and provide recommendations for implementation and sizing.

Below is an explanation of what is contained in this repository:

- '1. Final_output' contains documentation of the project output, final modelling software and design recommendations
- 'interim' contains detailed analytical and experimental analysis as well as our interim conclusions
- 'proposal' contains our intial proposal as well as preliminary analysis
- 'www' contains the markdown documents creating project website
