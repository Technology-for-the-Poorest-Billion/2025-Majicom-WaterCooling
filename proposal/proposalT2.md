# Problem description

Brief overview of the problem, context and engineering approach to tackle the problem, and explaining our approach in brief.

Assisted Passive Cooling is the process of continuously cooling the bulk water storage through indirect means. The aim is to achieve a drop of temperature of 3-5 degrees of the main tank through evaporative, radiative or other assisted passive cooling means.

### Types of Passive Cooling

### Project Focus 

Evaporative Cooling & Airflow:

There are two main questions with evaporative cooling to answer. Can we alter the design of the tank to improve the rate of surface evaporation and its effect on water temperature? Can we improve the airflow through the kiosk to prevent stagnation? These questions provide the foundation for the development of an evaporative cooling solution for the Majicom kiosk. The core aim is to verify the efficacy of evaporative cooling as a possible solution 

Core Deliverables:

- A redesigned tank geometry
- Ventillation location and fan positioning within the kiosk.
- Required fan power / size
- Material selection 

Secondary Deliverables:

- Dehumidification method for inlet air
- Simulation or demonstration of airflow quality
- 

Radiative Cooling:

Phase Changing Materials:

The main questions regarding phase changing material are to understand their capacity to remove energy from a system, how practically they are installed and whether they introduce any complexity into the operation or lifespan of the kiosk.

Core Deliverables:

- Measurement of energy removal by PCMs
- Demonstration that PCMs can be reset to their solid form
- Estimate of the volume of cool water that PCMs can produce before needing to reset

Secondary Deliverables: 

- Design of the tank to maximise water cooling
