Assisted Passive Cooling for Majicom 
Our team is developing a cheap, scalable passive cooling system for a solar-powered water purification kiosk in Tanzania. The local conditions are warm and humid, with a 6W solar panel powering the system. We’re focusing on assisted passive cooling - strategies that help retain cool temperatures rather than actively cooling the water, with a £150 budget and 3 weeks for testing.


1. Evaporative Cooling with Enhanced Airflow and Radiative Protection
 Expanded Concept:
This isn’t just wrapping the tank in a damp cloth, creating a controlled microclimate around the tank that maximises the efficiency of evaporation. The new design includes:
A wicking jacket made from breathable, high-capillarity fabric (cotton, jute).
A low-power fan system powered by surplus solar energy or a small battery, promoting constant airflow around the tank to increase evaporation rate.
Porous clay or terracotta panels between the jacket and tank (if accessible) to retain more moisture for longer-term evaporation.
Evaporation rate ∝ air velocity × (1 – relative humidity). In warm, humid climates like Tanzania, airflow is critical to maintain gradient-driven evaporation.


Shading prevents radiative heating which could otherwise offset cooling gains.


Clay elements retain water for longer and provide a delayed evaporative effect.


Fans also help prevent heat stagnation, especially if housed in a semi-enclosed kiosk structure.


 Real-world examples:
Zeer Pot Coolers (Nigeria, Sudan): Clay-pot-in-clay-pot with sand layer and water. Reduced produce temps by up to 14°C.


MIT Passive Cooling Pavilion (2019): Used porous ceramic panels + airflow to cool structures in hot humid climates.


Evaporative Cooling Pads in Greenhouses: Forced air fans + wet pad systems used across India and SE Asia.


Testing plan:
Set up fabric-wrapped water containers in boxes with reflective lids and mini USB fans (~5V).


Compare setups with/without fan, with/without reflective shade, with different fabrics.


Use dataloggers to capture temp/humidity data every 10 mins over 5–6 hours.
 Materials to test:
Natural wick fabrics (cotton, burlap)


Clay/terracotta sheets (if small ones are available)


USB/solar fans (~£10–15)


Mylar sheet or reflective plastic roofing


Simple timber frame for shade


1–2L water containers


Temp/humidity sensors


2. Modular PCM Cooling Panels with Heat Sink Integration
Expanded Concept:
Use modular PCM panels that clip around the tank, enhanced by aluminium heat spreader bars or thermal interface plates. PCMs melt at around 26–30°C, absorbing significant heat as they undergo phase change. The addition of thin aluminium fins helps conduct heat away from the water faster and into the PCM more efficiently. Recharge occurs naturally at night or during non-peak hours.
Additional layer: Wrap the PCM modules in reflective material to prevent solar gain, and include thermal insulation barrier between the outer environment and PCM.
Thermal Theory:
Heat flux into water → conducted via tank wall → transferred to PCM.


Aluminium’s high thermal conductivity (≈ 205 W/m·K) acts as a passive heat sink, speeding up energy transfer.


PCM stabilises temperature until it reaches full phase transition.


Modularity: Snap-on PCM sleeves around tank = easy maintenance + scalability.


Aluminium fin integration = improved thermal efficiency without energy use.


Reusability: PCMs can last 1,000+ cycles.


Real-world examples:
Arktek PCM cold storage device (WHO/UNICEF) used for vaccine transport - held temperature for 35 days without electricity.


Solar-powered refrigerators with PCMs: Used in Indian rural villages to stabilise cooling where solar output varies.


Insulated food delivery boxes (India, Kenya): Passive PCM systems are used in food tech logistics.


Testing plan:
Acquire 26–30°C PCM packs or make DIY ones with salt hydrate or paraffin wax.


Attach them around 1L water containers using elastic straps or heat tape.


Add aluminium strips between bottle and PCM packs.


Place under 200W heat lamp or direct sun for 4–6 hours.


Monitor internal temp and PCM melting behaviour.


Materials to test:
PCM packs or wax (~£30)


Recycled metal strips (from old laptops, thermal pads)


Bubble wrap or foam insulation (~£10)


IR thermometer


3D printed brackets or straps to attach panels (optional)



3. Insulated Tank: Air Gap + Radiative Cooling + Embedded Thermal Mass
Expanded Concept:
Build a double-wall tank with a 2–3 cm air cavity, wrapped externally in reflective foil, and embed thermal mass at the base using recycled ceramic tiles, stones, or water bricks. This slows heat gain and provides a thermal buffer. Optionally, integrate phase change gel packs into the base for hybrid PCM/insulation effect.
Mechanism:
The air gap reduces conductive heat gain (air is a poor conductor).


Reflective casing minimises radiative heat absorption.


The embedded thermal mass acts as a heat sink, absorbing energy slowly due to high heat capacity.


Strategically placing insulation and shielding in layers mimics passive building design principles (think "tiny thermos").


Why it’s innovative:
You create a layered passive thermal system with multiple protection mechanisms.


Entire tank structure can be built from inexpensive materials: plastic drums, tile, foil, reused cardboard.


Easily implemented in existing kiosk structures and adapted to local supply chains.


Examples:
Earthship Water Storage (New Mexico): Buried tanks using insulation and reflective barriers.


CoolAnt Tiles (Ant Studio, India): Passive cooling with terracotta honeycomb and airflow.


Thermal bricks in refrigeration trucks (Kenya): Used for reducing diesel cooling needs.


Testing plan:
Nest 1L bottle in a cardboard/plastic shell with 2cm air space.


Place bricks or tile fragments underneath or alongside.


Wrap outer shell with Mylar foil or metallic duct wrap.


Compare temps with a bare bottle, an insulated-only version, and full hybrid setup.


Materials to test:
Two container sizes (inner and outer shell)


Mylar foil (~£5)


Recycled tile/stone (free or cheap)


Bubble wrap, foam sheets (~£10)


Water bricks or DIY PCM base


Temp sensors
