# Problem description

The aim of this project is to investigate a way to chill water before distribution from a Majicom kiosk. The kiosks have been loated in tropical areas and require a way of cooling the water independently of temperature and humidity. This leads to 2 possibilities: active and passive cooling.

# Presentation of the proposal

### Project focus

Active cooling methods have been well-researched and applied in industry. Every fridge runs on an evaporative cycle and this technology is very well developed. Hence, there is no need for a proof of concept of this cooling method. However what this project will focus on is how to more efficiently use the energy and integrate this cooling method with the kiosk. This requires first a broad exploration of the ideaspace, followed by more detailed design and thermal modelling. The main determined tasks include: Broad exploration and design calculation for determining the most likely dierections for progress, detailed feasibility study ncluding costing and testing proof of concept designs.

Deliverables:

- exploration of the full design space of active water cooling system
- Investigation of alternative, aided water cooling methods including novel research ideas, such as teh use of  spectrally selective materials
- Providing proofs of concept of most promising water cooling methods
- Preliminary and detailed design, material and component selection
- Outline of the cost and impact of proposed solutions

### Reaserch areas

- Feasibility of the use of Peltier modules instead of Evaporative cycles
- Exploring the limiting factors on the speed of heat transfer and cold water dispensal
- exploring the suitability of chosen methods for local manufacture and repairs
- providing a proof of concept of the use of spectrally selective insulation
- 



# Assessment of the quality of the proposal

This project aims to bring what is considered common in developed countries - chilled water - to the developing world. It satisfies all the characteristics of inclusive innnovation as outlined below:
- Responsible - brings no negative impact and does no harm. Decreases teh problem of waste and low recyclanility of one time use water bottles
- Resposive - answers the needs of the users - from a survey on the trial users, 50% of them preferred chilled water
- Accessive - the project aims to more than halve the price of clean cold water to the users in Africa, while also reducing teh waste problem
- Context appriopriate - our solutions will be designed to be easy to repair or replace in the developing countries, focusing on the robustness and modularity
- Adds significant value - currently no other water kiosk is providing chilled water and as such this would be the first of its kind!


# Project management:

Large part of our project includes brainstorming and as such will require large collaboration. However each of us has separate strengths and the tasks will be tuned to satisfy them:

- Jakub - strengths: heat transfer and thermodynamics
- Oscar
- Jamie

These lead to the following intial task distribution:
- Jakub - feasibilty of Peltier modules and proof of concept of spectrally selective materials
- Oscar
- Jamie
To be filled: Budgeting, ease of access in the developing world, limit on heat transfer, CAD design and visualisation

Skills required:
- knowledge of the common practices and industry standards
- learing to use teh test equipment and manufacturing of proof of concept designs

Parts required:
At such an early stage it is difficult to exactly pinpoint what products will be necessary. However, for any tests to be conducted teh following will be necessary:
 - temperature probes
 - water containers
We have determined that most likely there is no need to make a proof of concept of the use of an evaporative cycle, which would take away large part of the risk and cost of the project otherwise.

# Risk assessment and contingency

In case there are issues with the arrival of parts necessary for the tests to be conducted, our project will focus more on the feasibility study and modelling of the most suitable areas for further development. In such case the main deliverable will be a clear research plan for Majicom for putting this research into practice leading to a quick and simple implementation of active cooling into the design.

Risk Assessment
A - back pain or repetitive strain injury from lifting heavy purchased components required
B - eye strain in front a computer
C - handling hazardous (cooling) materials may cause personal harm
D - ordered components do not arrive on time/stolen/otherwise delayed
E - going over budget
F - technical mistakes as a result of limited team expertise and experience in this field
G - team breakdown
H - other coursework/extracurriculars clashing to minimise output
I - later ordering of parts due to short timeframes

Contingency
Ie: parts fail to arrive in time, components don’t work or overall proof-of-concept fails to deliver
Would still be able to report on routes that are not suitable for further development as part of final report
The primary deliverable is multiple concepts deeply explored for feasibility, with stretch goals is 1–2 are made as a proof of concept, minimising risk of project being deemed a failure.

Personal injury
Follow SOPs to avoid injuries
Adhere to department health guidelines (especially when handling hazardous materials)

Minimise costs at all times to avoid overspend – thorough research into components purchased (and ethics behind them)
Maintain SOPs and good work ethics and discipline to minimise mistakes
Attempt to minimise missing necessary components through thorough cross-checking and project leader by COP 22/05
