Interim presentations
20 marks (individual)
This is to assess the progress of the project, and give preliminary feedback. Each student
must contribute to the presentation of their project in order to:
• Summarise the work done so far, flag issues and steps taken to overcome them;
• Where applicable, show an early prototype and demonstrate feasibility;
• Present a summary of team members' personal and technical development (what
have you learnt and how have you learned it?);
• Update the project development time-line and present a plan for completion.
Value will be given to:
• Team working skills, good log of work done and issues
• Troubleshooting skills and the ability to reassess objectives when necessary.
• Technical characterisation of how well the prototype meets the project objective
Presentations should be 5 minutes long per student. Make sure you split the time evenly
between team members. Each student would ideally present a specific aspect they have
contributed to (giving credits to other where appropriate) and briefly explain how the work
package they present fits within the overall project.
Marks are individual. They will reflect the overall progress of the project, the individual
contribution to the project, and the quality of the presentation.
